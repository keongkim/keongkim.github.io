      <description>We study the impact of software-based innovation on the value of patented inventions, firmsï¿½ competitive position in the product market, and the market value of the firms in the U.S. information and technology (IT) hardware industry. Our analysis of over 227,000 patents by 741 public IT hardware firms in the period of 1996?2006 reveals several novel findings. Patented inventions with greater software intensity are more frequently cited and more likely to be renewed for legal protection.</description>

      <description>To alleviate the information asymmetry between creators and crowdfunders, crowdfunding platforms often implement platform-wide rules, such as requiring creators to disclose potential risks of their project. This study combines multiple empirical methods (i.e., online experiments, text-based machine learning, and a differences-in-difference design) to examine whether and how risk disclosure of crowdfunding projects influences crowdfunders?project perceptions and funding decisions, with a particular focus on the contrast between technology projects and non-technology projects.</description>
