      <description>This study examines the effect of physical attractiveness of recipients on donations decisions in a prosocial microlending market by combining both the archival data analysis and controlled experiments. We find that physical attractiveness of female recipients mattters to donors. More attractive recipients tend to have a larger share of male donors, implying that male (female) donors are more (less) favorable toward those recipients. On the contrary, the physical attractiveness of male recipients did not change the composition significantly.</description>

      <description>We study the effect of cryptocurrency markets on borrowers in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending markets. By using the combined data from both markets during the period January 2017 to February 2018, we provide several novel findings. Our results indicate that the growth in cryptocurrency markets is associated with a large amount of loan requests in the P2P market. This complementarity is strong for borrowers who have good credit grades and are likely to have further knowledge of and might use the borrowed money for investing in the cryptocurrency market.</description>

      <description>To alleviate the information asymmetry between creators and crowdfunders, crowdfunding platforms often implement platform-wide rules, such as requiring creators to disclose potential risks of their project. This study combines multiple empirical methods (i.e., online experiments, text-based machine learning, and a differences-in-difference design) to examine whether and how risk disclosure of crowdfunding projects influences crowdfundersï¿½ project perceptions and funding decisions, with a particular focus on the contrast between technology projects and non-technology projects.</description>
