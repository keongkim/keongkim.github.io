      <description>Online platforms have emerged as an alternative method for companies to directly introduce and promote their products to their target audience, bypassing the need for third-party endorsements. However, the effectiveness of self-promotion compared to external promotion remains uncertain. This study utilizes role theory and focuses on a specialized online community platform for technological products to examine the impact of external promoters versus internal promoters. Our findings reveal that external promoters are more effective in promoting products, as they receive a higher number of upvotes from platform supporters compared to internal promoters.</description>

      <description>This study examines the effect of physical attractiveness of recipients on donations decisions in a prosocial microlending market by combining both the archival data analysis and controlled experiments. We find that physical attractiveness of female recipients mattters to donors. More attractive recipients tend to have a larger share of male donors, implying that male (female) donors are more (less) favorable toward those recipients. On the contrary, the physical attractiveness of male recipients did not change the composition significantly.</description>
