      <description>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) witnessed a skyrocketing growth from a market cap of just $100m in 2020 to over $22bn in 2021, according to the data from DappRadar. Despite tremendous eyeballs on the rise and fall of this market, fundamental recognitions on the economic mechanisms behind this ecosystem are quite limited.
In this project, we aim to provide a thorough understanding of the dynamics in this rising market. Specifically, we plan to explore from three aspects, including trader and creator behaviors, and platform evolutions.</description>

      <description>This study is an examination of initial coin offerings (ICOs), a new form of investment, using a fairly comprehensive dataset of 4,380 ICOs operating from 2017 to 2019. Specifically, we study whether ICO project creatorsâ€™ decisions on remaining in or leaving the countries of origin are affected by the ICO policy status of countries. Findings indicate that countries having ICO regulations are more likely to both retain and attract ICO projects.</description>

      <title>Equity Crowdfunding and Startup Performance</title>

      <description>This study examines the effect of equity crowdfunding on startup performance. To do so, it uses a novel dataset of equity crowdfunding startups from January 2016 to April 2019 and constructs a sample of matched non-crowdfunding startups. The data indicate that equity crowdfunding startups rather than non-crowdfunding startups are more likely to survive, and conditional on closure, their closing dates are later than those of non-crowdfunding startups. Equity crowdfunding startups also show higher growth in employment.</description>

      <title>How Online Social Interactions Facilitate the Spatial Diffusion of Crowdfunding</title>
      <link>https://keongkim.github.io/project/spatioal-diffusion-crowdfunding/</link>

      <description>This study documents the role of online social interactions in the diffusion of crowdfunding which has emerged as a viable alternative source of funding for creative projects and ventures around the world. Using the data on the creation of crowdfunding projects from a leading crowdfunding platform from 2009 to 2013 and Facebook Social Connectedness Index Data, we find that the number of crowdfunding projects initiated in an area is positively associated with the total number of prior crowdfunding projects from areas that are most socially connected online.</description>

      <description>This study examines the effect of physical attractiveness of recipients on donations decisions in a prosocial microlending market by combining both the archival data analysis and controlled experiments. We find that physical attractiveness of female recipients mattters to donors. More attractive recipients tend to have a larger share of male donors, implying that male (female) donors are more (less) favorable toward those recipients. On the contrary, the physical attractiveness of male recipients did not change the composition significantly.</description>

      <title>Complements Rather Than Substitutes: An Empirical Examination of Cryptocurrency and Online Peer-to-Peer Lending Markets</title>

      <description>We study the effect of cryptocurrency markets on borrowers in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending markets. By using the combined data from both markets during the period January 2017 to February 2018, we provide several novel findings. Our results indicate that the growth in cryptocurrency markets is associated with a large amount of loan requests in the P2P market. This complementarity is strong for borrowers who have good credit grades and are likely to have further knowledge of and might use the borrowed money for investing in the cryptocurrency market.</description>
