      <description>This study documents the role of online social interactions in the diffusion of crowdfunding which has emerged as a viable alternative source of funding for creative projects and ventures around the world. Using the data on the creation of crowdfunding projects from a leading crowdfunding platform from 2009 to 2013 and Facebook Social Connectedness Index Data, we find that the number of crowdfunding projects initiated in an area is positively associated with the total number of prior crowdfunding projects from areas that are most socially connected online.</description>

      <description>This study examines the effect of physical attractiveness of recipients on donations decisions in a prosocial microlending market by combining both the archival data analysis and controlled experiments. We find that physical attractiveness of female recipients mattters to donors. More attractive recipients tend to have a larger share of male donors, implying that male (female) donors are more (less) favorable toward those recipients. On the contrary, the physical attractiveness of male recipients did not change the composition significantly.</description>

      <title>Complements Rather Than Substitutes: An Empirical Examination of Cryptocurrency and Online Peer-to-Peer Lending Markets</title>

      <description>We study the effect of cryptocurrency markets on borrowers in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending markets. By using the combined data from both markets during the period January 2017 to February 2018, we provide several novel findings. Our results indicate that the growth in cryptocurrency markets is associated with a large amount of loan requests in the P2P market. This complementarity is strong for borrowers who have good credit grades and are likely to have further knowledge of and might use the borrowed money for investing in the cryptocurrency market.</description>

      <title>Soft but Strong: Software-based Innovation, Product Market Competition, and Value Creation in the IT Hardware Industry</title>

      <description>We study the impact of software-based innovation on the value of patented inventions, firmsï¿½ competitive position in the product market, and the market value of the firms in the U.S. information and technology (IT) hardware industry. Our analysis of over 227,000 patents by 741 public IT hardware firms in the period of 1996?2006 reveals several novel findings. Patented inventions with greater software intensity are more frequently cited and more likely to be renewed for legal protection.</description>

      <title>Disclosure of Project Risk in Crowdfunding</title>

      <description>To alleviate the information asymmetry between creators and crowdfunders, crowdfunding platforms often implement platform-wide rules, such as requiring creators to disclose potential risks of their project. This study combines multiple empirical methods (i.e., online experiments, text-based machine learning, and a differences-in-difference design) to examine whether and how risk disclosure of crowdfunding projects influences crowdfunders?project perceptions and funding decisions, with a particular focus on the contrast between technology projects and non-technology projects.</description>

      <title>Information Technology and Baumol&#39;s Disease: How IT Influences Productivity of Service Activities</title>
      <link>https://keongkim.github.io/project/it-baumol-disease/</link>

      <description>Although service activities across a variety of industries suffer from Baumol&amp;rsquo;s cost disease, arguably advances in IT can help to overcome some of the regressive characteristics of &amp;ldquo;stagnant&amp;rdquo; services. To test this conjecture, we collected longitudinal data from 1985 to 2008 on about 60 micro-level service activities at the Social Security Administration (SSA), one of the largest service organizations in the world that touches lives of 162 million Americans and about 94% of all workers in the United States.</description>
